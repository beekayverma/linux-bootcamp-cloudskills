## I chose NorwayEast as it's closer to my location which I preferred.##


b@Azure:~$ az group create --name myResourceGroup --location norwayeast

Create virtual machine
Create a VM with the az vm create command.

The following example creates a VM named myVM and adds a user account named azureuser. The --generate-ssh-keys parameter is used to automatically generate an SSH key, and put it in the default key location (~/.ssh). To use a specific set of keys instead, use the --ssh-key-values option.

az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys

It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources. The following example output shows the VM create operation was successful.

{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/c435899a-73cb-4760-9b86-80ff41a8e74e/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "norwayeast",
  "macAddress": "00-22-48-75-59-CA",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "PU.BL.IC.IP",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "zones": ""
}

Note your own publicIpAddress in the output from your VM. This address is used to access the VM in the next steps.

_____________________

Open port 80 for web traffic
By default, only SSH connections are opened when you create a Linux VM in Azure. Use az vm open-port to open TCP port 80 for use with the NGINX web server:

az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM

THIS WILL HAVE A REALLY LONG OUTPUT. BUT IT WILL DO THE TRICK FOR YOU!

_______________________

Connect to virtual machine
SSH to your VM as normal. Replace the IP address in the example with the public IP address of your VM as noted in the previous output:

ssh azureuser@PU.BL.IC.IP

THIS WILL PROMPT TO ASK YES/NO TO CONNECT TO VM AND AUTHORIZE THE FINGERPRINT KEY AND ADD DETAILS OF HOST ON LOCAL MACHINE.

__________________________

Install web server
To see your VM in action, install the NGINX web server. Update your package sources and then install the latest NGINX package.

sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install nginx

THE -Y OPTION WILL NOT PROMPT FOR YES/NO BUT TAKE YES AS DEFAULT TO BYPASS THIS STEP AND THEN INSTALL UPDATE + NGINX 

______________________________

Clean up resources
When no longer needed, you can use the az group delete command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

az group delete --name myResourceGroup
